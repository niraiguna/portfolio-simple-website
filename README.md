Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website! This project contains the source code for my personal portfolio site, created using HTML and basic CSS.

I'm Niraimathi Gunasekaran, and this website serves as a showcase of my projects and a way for others to get in touch with me.

Home: The home page provides an introduction to who I am and what I do. Visitors can learn more about my skills and interests here.

Future Plans :
While the website is currently simple, I plan to expand and improve it in the future. Potential enhancements include:

Adding more projects to the portfolio.
Improving the visual design and layout.
Incorporating additional features for a better user experience.
